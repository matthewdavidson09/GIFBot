### ⚠️ GitHub Token Limitations

This action will skip commenting on pull requests from forks due to GitHub's security restrictions on the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

If you want to enable commenting on forked PRs, consider using a [Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with appropriate `repo` permissions.
